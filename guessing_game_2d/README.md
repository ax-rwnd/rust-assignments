# Guessing Game
A simple guessing game written in the rust programming language. Most of the code was borrowed from [this swell tutorial](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html "The rust book").

## Running the game
To run the game, you should:
1. `cargo update` to grab the dependencies.
2. `cargo run` to compile and run the files.

## Features
Besides actually playing the game, there are a few commands available:
* `exit` exits the program.
* `wins` lists your current score.
* `tries` lists your current tries.
* `cheat` lets you view the current secret, but resets your wins.
